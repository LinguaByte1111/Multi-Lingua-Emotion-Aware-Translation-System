### 1Ô∏è‚É£ About the Project

The Multi-Lingua Emotion Aware Translation System is an intelligent multilingual translation platform that not only translates text across 30 languages (including the top 20 Indian and top 10 global languages) but also integrates emotion awareness for richer communication.

*‚ú® Key Highlights:

  * üåê Multilingual Translation: Seamless translation across 30 languages.

  * üòÉ Emotion Recognition: Detects emotions in text and speech for emotion-matched text-to-speech output.

  * üßê Sarcasm Detection: A rule-based sarcasm detection system ensures contextually accurate translations.

This system bridges the gap between linguistic accuracy and emotional intelligence, making conversations more natural, expressive, and human-like.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Project Architecture

The system is designed as a modular pipeline with clearly defined components:

flowchart TD
    A[Input Text / Speech] --> B[Language Detection]
    B --> C[Translation Engine]
    C --> D[Emotion Recognition Module]
    D --> E[Sarcasm Detection Rules]
    E --> F[Emotion-Matched Text-to-Speech]
    F --> G[Output in Target Language]

üîß Components

Language Detection: Identifies source language among 30 supported ones.

Translation Engine: Handles multilingual translation tasks.

Emotion Recognition: Detects emotions (happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.) from text/speech.

Sarcasm Detection: Rule-based approach for refining contextual meaning.

Speech Synthesis: Produces emotion-aware speech output.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset and Preprocessing

This project does not rely on a single fixed dataset but instead integrates dynamic input processing for text and speech:

* Text Input:

  * Language is auto-detected using deep-translator (GoogleTranslator).
  * Input text is preprocessed by converting to lowercase and stripping whitespace.

* Emotion Detection:

  * Handled using NRCLex, which assigns probabilities to emotions such as joy, anger, sadness, trust, anticipation, fear, surprise, disgust.
  * A threshold-based filter avoids false positives.

* Sarcasm Detection:

  * Uses a rule-based keyword spotting approach for common sarcastic cues in English, Hindi, and Hinglish (e.g., ‚Äúwah‚Äù, ‚Äúgreat‚Äù, ‚Äúoh really‚Äù).

* Speech Input:

  * Audio is transcribed with OpenAI Whisper (small model).

Preprocessing ensures non-empty audio streams are converted into plain text before translation and emotion analysis.
