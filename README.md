### 1️⃣ About the Project

The Multi-Lingua Emotion Aware Translation System is an intelligent multilingual translation platform that not only translates text across 30 languages (including the top 20 Indian and top 10 global languages) but also integrates emotion awareness for richer communication.

* ✨ Key Highlights:

  * 🌐 Multilingual Translation: Seamless translation across 30 languages.

  * 😃 Emotion Recognition: Detects emotions in text and speech for emotion-matched text-to-speech output.

  * 🧐 Sarcasm Detection: A rule-based sarcasm detection system ensures contextually accurate translations.

This system bridges the gap between linguistic accuracy and emotional intelligence, making conversations more natural, expressive, and human-like.

### 2️⃣ Project Architecture

The system is designed as a modular pipeline with clearly defined components:

flowchart TD
    A[Input Text / Speech] --> B[Language Detection]
    B --> C[Translation Engine]
    C --> D[Emotion Recognition Module]
    D --> E[Sarcasm Detection Rules]
    E --> F[Emotion-Matched Text-to-Speech]
    F --> G[Output in Target Language]

🔧 Components

Language Detection: Identifies source language among 30 supported ones.

Translation Engine: Handles multilingual translation tasks.

Emotion Recognition: Detects emotions (happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.) from text/speech.

Sarcasm Detection: Rule-based approach for refining contextual meaning.

Speech Synthesis: Produces emotion-aware speech output.

### 3️⃣ Dataset and Preprocessing

This project does not rely on a single fixed dataset but instead integrates dynamic input processing for text and speech:

* Text Input:

  * Language is auto-detected using deep-translator (GoogleTranslator).
  * Input text is preprocessed by converting to lowercase and stripping whitespace.

* Emotion Detection:

  * Handled using NRCLex, which assigns probabilities to emotions such as joy, anger, sadness, trust, anticipation, fear, surprise, disgust.
  * A threshold-based filter avoids false positives.

* Sarcasm Detection:

  * Uses a rule-based keyword spotting approach for common sarcastic cues in English, Hindi, and Hinglish (e.g., “wah”, “great”, “oh really”).

* Speech Input:

  * Audio is transcribed with OpenAI Whisper (small model).

Preprocessing ensures non-empty audio streams are converted into plain text before translation and emotion analysis.

### 4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Unlike traditional ML projects with fixed datasets, this system relies on real-time inputs. EDA here focuses on testing and validating outputs from integrated modules:

🔍 Text Translation Analysis:

  * Verified translation accuracy across 30 supported languages (20 Indian + 10 global).
  * Checked robustness for mixed-language sentences (e.g., Hinglish).

🎭 Emotion Detection Analysis:

  * Sample sentences were tested to observe distribution of emotion scores using NRCLex.
  * Thresholding helped reduce noise (e.g., sentences wrongly classified with multiple low-confidence emotions).

#### Example:

* Input: “I can’t believe this happened, wow great…”

  Detected Emotion: Disgust / Anger
  Sarcasm flag: Triggered

#### 🧐 Sarcasm Detection Checks

* Tested with sarcastic phrases in English, Hindi, and Hinglish.
* Keywords like “wah”, “oh really”, “yeah right”, “kya baat hai” successfully triggered sarcasm detection.

#### 🎤 Speech Processing

* Evaluated Whisper model for speech-to-text on English and Hindi recordings.
* Checked transcription accuracy for noisy vs. clean audio.
* Validated conversion to text before translation and emotion classification.
