### 1Ô∏è‚É£ About the Project

The Multi-Lingua Emotion Aware Translation System is an intelligent multilingual translation platform that not only translates text across 30 languages (including the top 20 Indian and top 10 global languages) but also integrates emotion awareness for richer communication.

‚ú® Key Highlights:

üåê Multilingual Translation: Seamless translation across 30 languages.

üòÉ Emotion Recognition: Detects emotions in text and speech for emotion-matched text-to-speech output.

üßê Sarcasm Detection: A rule-based sarcasm detection system ensures contextually accurate translations.

This system bridges the gap between linguistic accuracy and emotional intelligence, making conversations more natural, expressive, and human-like.
